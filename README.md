# AM7020-module-fritzing-part

## 喜歡請給個星星吧Orz

由於v1.0的grove插座設計有失誤所以此fritzing part會分成v1.0 和 v1.1兩個版本  
Due to an error in the design of the grove socket in v1.0, this fritzing part will be divided into two versions: v1.0 and v1.1

This is AM7020 v1.0 fritzing part

This is AM7020 v1.1 fritzing part

你可以自由使用這個fritzing part，但是請標註作者  
You are free to use this fritzing part(by giving me a star  and mark the author)  

請注意本圖示pcb部分僅供參考，本人不負責任和pcb生產時產生誤差的損失
